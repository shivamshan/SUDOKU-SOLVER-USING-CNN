# SUDOKU-SOLVER-USING-CNN
This project makes use of **CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)** to solve a **sudoko puzzle.**</br>
</br>
A **picture** of the **sudoku puzzle** can be taken and uploaded in the application, which then gives out a **picture of the the solved puzzle** with the blank cells 
filled with the appropriate numbers.
